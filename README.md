# Flow-Shop-Scheduling-Problem-Based-on-Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm
In this project I adopted the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the flow shop scheduling problem, obtained  the optimal solution of the given ten samples, conducted the experiment with the control variates  method, observed the influence of each parameter in the experiment on the result and code execution time, and analyzed the causes of these influences from the perspective of principle.
